### Course information

This is the website for the PhD course Advanced Bayesian Learning.

The computer labs (the only examination) is to be done at your  (that was always the plan).

Here is what YOU need to do to get the Zoom-link: send me an email with title

Zoom for Advanced Bayesian Learning

In the body of the email write

- Your Name
- Which Swedish PhD programme you are admitted to (I can only accept students from Swedish programmes due to time constraints).

I will then add you to an email list and send out an email before the course stats with the Zoom link. I will not post the link online, for security reasons.
Please send me this email even if you have already sent me an email before.  ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)

**The typical participant** is a PhD student in Statistics or related fields (Mathematical Statistics, Engineering Science, Quantitative Finance, Computer Science, ...). The participants are expected to have taken a basic course in Bayesian methods, for example Bayesian Learning at Linköping University or Bayesian Statistics I at Stockholm University.

**Examination and Grades**: The course is graded Pass or Fail. Examination is through individual reports on distributed problems for each topic. Many of the problems will require computer implementations of Bayesian learning algorithms.

**Course organization**
The course is organized in four topics, each containing four lecture hours. Course participants will spend most of their study time by solving the problem sets for each topic on their own computers without supervision.

All lectures are given online using Zoom.

Welcome!
