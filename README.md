### Course information
**The typical participant** has is PhD student in Statistics or related fields (Mathematical Statistics, Automatic Control, Quantitative Finance, Computer Science, ...). The participants are expected to have taken a basic course in Bayesian methods, for example Bayesian Learning at Link√∂ping University or Bayesian Statistics I at Stockholm University.

**Examination and Grades**: The course is graded Pass or Fail. Examination is through individual reports on distributed problenms for each topic. Many of the problems will require computer implementations of Bayesian learning algorithms.

**Course organization**
The course is organized in four topics, each containing four lecture hours. Course participants will spend most of their study time by solving the problem sets for each topic on their own computers without supervision.
